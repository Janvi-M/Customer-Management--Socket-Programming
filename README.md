Customer Management System Using Socket Programming

This project involves developing a Customer Management System utilizing socket programming in Python, with a TCP connection. The system incorporates the following key features:

1. Socket Programming with TCP Connection:
The application leverages socket programming to establish and manage a TCP connection between clients and the server.

3. Database Integration:
Customer data is stored and managed using a CSV file as the database.

3. SSL Certificate Integration:
To ensure secure communication, the system employs SSL certificates.
The necessary SSL certificate files, such as key.pem and csr.pem, are sourced from the internet to facilitate encrypted connections.
